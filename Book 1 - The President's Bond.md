### Book 1: _“The Queen’s Secret”_

- **Setting**: An elite private academy in a Western city, where status is defined not only by grades, looks, and legacy — but by the power and beauty of your familiar. The wealthy flaunt theirs like fashion, the poor are taught to hide theirs.
    
- **Heroine**: **Valeria “Val” Reyes** — school president, disciplined to the point of obsession, secretly ashamed of her family’s poverty and incomplete knowledge of her own lineage. Her familiar is a **shadowy, half-formed elephant** she doesn’t understand — mistaken by others as a failure to bond. What they don’t know is that it’s ancient… and waiting.
    
- **Secret Job**: Val is a rising-star **anonymous voice actor** — performing sensual, boundary-pushing storytelling and ASMR-like erotica under a fake persona on a streaming platform. It's not explicit, but the intimacy of it would **shatter her “perfect student” image** if discovered. She does it to support her mother and younger sister, but she **carries deep shame** about what it says about her.
    
- **Love Interest**: **Cade West** — the school’s golden boy: rich, aloof, impossibly graceful. His **familiar is a snow leopard**, half-shadowed and incomplete — something his family hides and shuns him for. He’s a bastard child of a powerful lineage and a quiet woman no one remembers. He’s always known his familiar was missing something — until Val helps him find it.
    
- **Inciting Incident**: One night, Cade finds her voice by accident — and catches sight of her at a dress-up cafe. He's blown away by the straight and narrow class president who always scolds him working at such a cutesy place, stunned by the truth. The model student president has a second self — sensual, vulnerable, secretive.
    
- **Tension**: Cade doesn’t expose her. Instead, he **starts watching her stream**, learning the layers beneath her mask. At school, he teases her, protects her, tests her. She’s suspicious — terrified that he’ll use her secret against her. But when a group of classmates attempts to blackmail her with a blurry photo from the stream, **Cade steps in and unleashes his shadow-leopard**, striking fear without violence. It’s the first time she sees someone _use a shadow form as strength_. And the first time he sees a glimpse of her familiar, emerging in a surge of defense — a trunk of pale light curling through smoke.
    
- **Subtext**: They both wear masks — hers is honor, his is ease. He hides **shame under control**; she hides **pain under perfection**. They each carry **incomplete familiars** — beings who mirror their deepest selves. Only together can those familiars become whole.


Perfect.
