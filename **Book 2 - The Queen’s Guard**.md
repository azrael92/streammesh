**Book Two of the _The President's Secret_ Series**

> **Her secret is no longer just hers. His power is no longer just his. And what binds them could burn a kingdom to the ground.**

Valeria Reyes has survived her greatest fear: being seen. Her carefully built image is cracked open — and Cade West saw everything. But instead of wielding her secret as a weapon, he protected it.  
Worse, he understood it.  
Now he’s the only person she can’t push away… and the only one who knows the name her familiar whispers in the dark.

Her mythic elephant — once just a shadow in her periphery — begins to stir more vividly, responding to Cade’s presence like the two were cut from some ancient thread. But power like hers isn’t meant to go unnoticed, and the school’s elite families begin to circle. They know the signs. They’ve seen the old blood return before. And they will do anything to keep it from rising again.

Cade is battling shadows of his own. His snow leopard familiar remains half-formed — regal in posture, incomplete in essence. But in Val’s presence, it starts to change. The shadow moves with more intent. It begins to shift. It begins to **hunt**.  
And one night, as Cade trains alone, the leopard vanishes — replaced by something older. Something terrible. Something that **remembers**.

Together, they are unlocking pieces of a myth long buried: the Dominion Bond — a rare pairing of familiars who once ruled the natural order through unity, not conquest.

But as Val digs into her family’s past and Cade’s lineage begins to reassert itself, threats arrive from every direction:

- A new vice headmaster sent by Cade’s father to “evaluate familiar integrity.”
    
- A curious noble girl who claims to know Cade’s destiny — and thinks Val is unworthy of it.
    
- Whispers of a ritual that might complete Val’s bond… at a devastating cost.
    

Amid the chaos, Val finds herself asking the question she’s always feared:  
**If someone sees your darkest self and stays — is that still love? Or is it surrender?**

> **In a world of half-truths and gilded lies, she must learn to stop hiding her strength. He must learn to stop apologizing for his power.  
> Together, they will wake something ancient. And once it rises, there is no turning back.**
