### 📕 _The Queen’s War_
**Book Three of the _Dominion Bond_ Series**

> **The world taught them to fight for power. They’re choosing to fight for each other.**

Valeria Reyes and Cade West have claimed their power — not by legacy, but by love, loss, and truth. Their familiars are fully awakened now: her mythic elephant, steady and radiant, and his once-broken snow leopard, now merged with a forgotten king of beasts. Together, they embody the long-lost Dominion Bond — a pairing powerful enough to reshape the balance between elite bloodlines and forgotten families.

But power like theirs doesn’t go unanswered.

**Thad Rothmore**, the golden heir to the sister academy, arrives with charm, connections, and a storm of quiet cruelty. He digs into Val’s family history, unearths her father’s disgrace, and weaponizes it against her — all while publicly taunting Cade about his illegitimacy.  
His familiar? A white cobra coiled with illusion magic and venom that doesn’t need fangs to kill — it poisons reputation, warps memory, and crushes trust.

Backing him is his grandmother — a relic of the old bloodline wars — who believes that only brutality preserves power. She has groomed Thad as the perfect heir: brilliant, charismatic, and utterly sociopathic.

### 🤝 The Alliance with Elisabeth

**Elisabeth**, the highborn girl raised on duty, was once Cade’s presumed match — in power, mind, and status. She doesn’t concede him to Val. But she **respects Val’s strength** — and more importantly, sees Thad for what he is.

> “I don’t care if the elephant and the shadow-cat rule the skies. I care that Thad wants to set it all on fire.”

Elisabeth joins Val and Cade **not as a friend**, but as a **strategic partner**. Her familiar — a platinum-winged falcon — can fly ahead, scout, and intercept illusion magic. She becomes their **early-warning system**, a guardian of the air.

### ⚔️ The Duel – Stakes and Climax

| Character     | Final Familiar Form                                                      | Role in Climax                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Val**       | Radiant mythic elephant, fully formed, tusks etched with ancestral runes | Grounds illusions, defends allies, breaks Thad’s terrain magic with raw force                                                            |
| **Cade**      | Dominion leopard-cat, fully merged with ancient Ailuren                  | Counters cobra illusions, uses shadow-step to disable Thad’s precision attacks                                                           |
| **Elisabeth** | Sky-forged falcon, mirror-feathered                                      | Disrupts control spells and illusion veils, blinds Thad’s familiar                                                                       |
| **Thad**      | White cobra — elegant, venomous, manipulates light and trust             | Nearly overwhelms them by sowing confusion and memory breaks — until Val directly resists and **remembers herself**, anchoring the field |

> **Final Move**: Cade corners Thad — not with brute strength, but by **forcing him to face his grandmother’s commands aloud**. Elisabeth invokes the Familiar Code: if a bonded wielder speaks harm while under influence, the bond is broken. Thad’s cobra disbands — not dead, but ashamed.

### 🎓 Ending Notes

- **Thad is publicly shamed**, not destroyed — elite society begins to fracture.
    
- **Elisabeth and Val shake hands** — wary respect, but no reconciliation over Cade.
    
- **Cade chooses neither world** — he walks Val home after graduation, their familiars at their sides.
    
- **Val’s sister watches from the crowd**, her own familiar just beginning to stir.
