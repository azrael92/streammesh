Below is a structured **1–3-month reading & watching plan** designed to give your protégé the historical, economic, financial, and geopolitical context that underlies most major U.S. and global headlines. You can treat this as a **12-week (3-month) syllabus**, or accelerate it into 4–6 weeks by combining or shortening modules. Each week has a focused theme, with specific readings, videos/documentaries, and “daily habits” (brief routines) that reinforce context-building. At the end, there is a suggested **accelerated 4-week track** if you need to compress everything into one month.

---

## How to Use This Plan

1. **Daily Habit (every morning, \~30–45 minutes)**

   * **News Scan (20–30 min):**

     * **Financial Times (FT.com)** or **Wall Street Journal** – focus on front-page headlines and “Markets”/“Economy” sections.
     * **The Economist (weekly magazine)** (if available): read at least the **“Leaders”** (editorials) and one Economy/Finance piece.
   * **Weekly Reflection (Friday afternoon, \~15–20 min):**

     * Jot down one headline that puzzled him during the week and try to outline the “cause→effect” chain based on what he’s learned so far.
   * **Optional Podcast (15–30 min, while commuting):**

     * **FT News Briefing** or **WSJ Morning Brief** (daily 10-minute overview).
     * **Planet Money** (NPR) for 2–3 episodes per week on relevant topics.

2. **Pacing**

   * **3-Month Track (12 weeks):** Follow each weekly module in order.
   * **1-Month Accelerated Track (4 weeks):** See “Accelerated 4-Week Plan” at the bottom—combine themes where noted.

3. **Format**

   * Each week = 1 major theme.
   * **Reading:** mix of short articles (2,500–5,000 words) and one longer “overview” (research papers, book excerpts, or essays).
   * **Watching:** one or two videos (documentaries, lectures, or narrated explainers) that bring the theme alive.
   * **Optional Deep-Dives:** (for Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) if your protégé wants to drill further, a suggested book or longer report is listed.

## Additional Tips for Your Protégé

1. **Make a “Timeline Cheat Sheet.”**

   * As he completes each week, have him record on a single page:

     * Key dates (e.g., 1944 – Bretton Woods, 1971 – Nixon ends gold, 2008 – Lehman collapse, 2018 – China-U.S. tariffs).
     * One‐sentence summaries of what happened and why.

2. **Build a “Policy Vocabulary.”**

   * Maintain a living glossary:

     * Monetarism | Fiscal Multiplier | Stagflation | Quantitative Easing | Basel III | SDRs | Sovereign Wealth Fund.
     * Add new entries every time a term arises in readings or news.

3. **Weekly “Headline Drill.”**

   * Each Friday, pick one “mystery headline” (e.g., “ECB warns of ‘no return to pre‐Covid normal’”).
   * Task him to map out:

     1. “Root Causes” (e.g., pandemic scarring, supply shortages, inflation pressures).
     2. “Mechanism” (e.g., why isn’t policy cutting? Because wage growth & core inflation remain high).
     3. “Potential Effect” (e.g., slower growth → credit tightening in Europe → credit spread widening).

4. **Focus on “Interconnections.”**

   * Whenever reading about an event in one region, ask: “How might this affect U.S. Treasuries? The dollar? Oil prices? Emerging markets?”
   * By Week 8–9, he should start connecting—for instance—China’s credit impulse → commodity prices → U.S. inflation.

5. **Use Data Trackers.**

   * Encourage him to bookmark:

     * **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).**
     * **World Bank “DataBank”** (for global GDP, trade, commodity prices).
   * Have him glance weekly to see if any major indices (CPI, PPI, unemployment, copper/oil prices) are deviating.

## Final Notes

1. **Adjust as You Go:** If your protégé is breezing through Week 5 (Dot-Com + GFC), let him speed to Week 6 (2008) in the same week. The goal is mastery of context, not rigid timing.

2. **Emphasize Cause→Effect Thinking:** For every reading/video, insist that he jot down on his own: “What were the top 2–3 economic/political drivers? How did they feed into markets?” That habit is the most important “takeaway.”

3. **Stay Flexible on Deep-Dives:** If he’s already well-versed in, say, 2008 crisis mechanics, skip some of the longer readings and move on. Conversely, if he struggles with one module, let him spend an extra day on it.

4. **Leverage Short Summaries:** Most book excerpts and academic papers suggested are either 8–12 pages. Emphasize that  quality (grasp of the core insight) is more important than finishing every single page.

5. **After Three Months:** He should be able to look at any headline—say, “G-7 Considers Carbon Border Tax”—and immediately frame:

   * “Cause: European push to offset emissions, U.S. supply chain concerns.”
   * “Effect: Potential labyrinth of trade retaliation, shifts in import patterns, stranding of certain commodities.”

By following this plan—whether spread over 12 weeks (recommended) or compressed into 4–6 weeks—your protégé will build the mental scaffolding needed to parse almost any headline, identify the underlying cause-and-effect logic, and anticipate the market or policy consequences. Good luck to both of you!
